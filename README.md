## Installation:

You can find Cyclone [here.](https://github.com/reilleya/cyclone) Follow the installation instructions provided.

Once Cyclone is installed, put the "guistuff" folder, the "Run.bat" file, and the "Cyclone Data Intake.py" script in the "cyclone-main" folder

Go into the "guistuff" folder, and create a new folder called "tempLayers" (Needs to match this exactly)

NOTE: sometimes when installing Cyclone, running the command to install the dependencies can throw a bunch of errors. Running ```npm i canvas``` then the normal ```npm i``` command can help with this.

## Usage

To run the program, go into the "cyclone-main" folder, and run "Run.bat"
